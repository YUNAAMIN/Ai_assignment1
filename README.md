Introduction:<br>
Usually the tables are arranged randomly for the people sitting, that leads to  conflicts happening. And sometimes they don't even feel comfortable too .so, we will evaluate and try out some search algorithms like (USC,Greedy ,A*), to  find the best way to arrange the seating based onthe Non-Linear Dislike Cost function and  the  guide table that was attached to the assignment . It represents people's (pairs) dislike rates.
Heuristic Table (Dislike Matrix) that provided in the assignment : The heuristic table shows the dislike percentage between pairs that the highest percentage means greater dislike or conflict. 

The main goal:
The main goal is to arrange people around a table in such a way as to minimize conflict. So that everyone at least can talk to their neighbors.

Requirements: 
 Each person should be seated next to their neighbors on the left and right to facilitate conversation.  
The seating arrangement should form a closed loop, as it is a round table.
